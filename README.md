# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

E-Commerce Application - Milestone 2
The E-Commerce Application is a feature-rich, full-stack web application that enables users to:

Browse and search for products. Register and securely log in to their accounts. Manage their orders with an intuitive user interface. Backend The application’s backend is responsible for core operations such as:

User Authentication: Securely registering users and validating logins. Product Management: Storing, retrieving, and managing product data. Order Handling: Managing customer orders, payment statuses, and transaction details. Frontend The frontend ensures a user-friendly interface with features like:

A responsive design for seamless usage across devices. Intuitive navigation and interaction flows. Integration with the backend for dynamic data retrieval and updates. By utilizing the MERN stack, this application delivers seamless communication between the client (frontend) and server (backend), creating a robust and efficient e-commerce platform.

Learning Goals
At the end of this milestone, you will:

Understand the overall structure of a MERN project, including how each component interacts. Learn the foundational steps required to set up and organize a full-stack project. Gain clarity on the essential functionalities of an e-commerce application. Prepare for upcoming development phases by setting up the project repository and laying the groundwork for advanced features. Key Features of the Project This e-commerce application is packed with features that reflect the capabilities of modern web development. Key highlights include:

1. MERN Stack Complete end-to-end development using JavaScript, simplifying the development process. Integration of MongoDB for database management, Express.js and Node.js for backend logic, and React.js for building an interactive frontend.
2. REST API Creation Develop scalable, well-structured APIs to handle key tasks such as: User Authentication: User login and registration endpoints. Product Management: Adding, updating, and retrieving product details. Order Handling: Processing and managing customer orders.
3. Authentication Implement secure user authentication mechanisms, including password hashing and session/token management, to protect sensitive user data.
4. Database Schema Design Design structured, efficient, and scalable data models using MongoDB. Create schemas for users, products, orders, and other essential entities.
5. Backend Development Build a robust backend to handle business logic, database interactions, and API endpoints using Node.js and Express.
6. Frontend Development Leverage React.js to create a responsive and dynamic user interface, enabling seamless interaction with the backend. What’s Included in Milestone 1?
7. Project Vision and Goals A detailed overview of the project’s purpose, vision, and long-term goals.
8. Live Demonstration A live walkthrough of the completed application, showcasing its functionality, features, and potential impact.
9. Core Concepts Introduced MERN Stack Overview: Learn how MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js work together to form a complete development stack. REST API Structure: Gain a clear understanding of how APIs are structured, how endpoints work, and how they connect the frontend and backend. Database Schema Design: Explore the basics of designing database schemas that are optimized for scalability and performance. Authentication Basics: Learn the importance of user authentication and how it secures sensitive user data. Core Concepts Covered
10. MERN Stack A modern and efficient stack for full-stack JavaScript development. Advantages of using a single programming language (JavaScript) across the stack.
11. REST API How to create, structure, and test RESTful APIs. Implementing CRUD operations for various resources like users, products, and orders.
12. MongoDB Schema Design Creating schemas for different entities in the application. Structuring relationships between data for optimal query performance.
13. Authentication Implementing secure authentication mechanisms using industry-standard practices. Submission Guidelines Push the repository to GitHub and ensure it is publicly accessible. Include this README file summarizing Milestone 1. Share the GitHub repository link as instructed. Next Steps In the upcoming lesson, you will:
Set up the Development Environment: Install the tools and dependencies needed for MERN stack development. Understand Server-Client Interaction: Learn how the frontend communicates with the backend using APIs. Create a Basic Server: Use Node.js and Express to set up a simple server as the foundation for further backend development.
